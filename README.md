Questions
For questions about the usage of the librarie, bugs or issue, please post a question on the Arduino forum at info@open-electronics.org

Bugs and issues
For bugs in the libraries, please fill in an issue in Github as that makes it far easier to track them. 
If possible provide a minimal code snippet that exposes the bug. Also proposals for solutions are welcome.

Issues are not bugs but still possible problematic. E.g. if a library is too slow for your application that is
an issue, not a bug. Please fill in an issue and provide as much details about your requirements.

Improvements and changes
For improvements and changes, please provide a pull request. I will try to follow up on them asap but it can take
quite some time. Please try to be generic in your improvements and try to see "over the needs of your own application".

License and Warranty
Please check the file LICENSE.md for the details.
