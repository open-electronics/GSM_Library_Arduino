* Leds management

- Led Trigger 3 used during GSM engine initializattion.
  T = 250mSec - 25% ON - 75% OFF (Fast blink)
- Led Trigger 3 used after GSM engine initialization to indicate that the initialization process is terminated.
  T = 2Sec - 25% ON - 75% OFF (Very Slow blink)
- When the system process a command the led Trigger 3 is fixed turn on. After command processing the led 3
  turn off. The led Trigger 3 return to blink very slow 

- Led associate to the relay 1: Led 4 (Red) wired to the I/O 37 (Pin 62)
  If relay 1 ON led 4 ON; if relay 1 OFF led 4 OFF
- Led associate to the relay 2: Led 5 (Red) wired to the I/O 36 (Pin 61)
  If relay 2 ON led 5 ON; if relay 2 OFF led 5 OFF 

- Led associate to the input 1: Led 6 (Yellow) wired to the I/O 35 (Pin 64)
  If input 1 ON led 6 ON; if input 1 OFF led 6 OFF
- Led associate to the input 2: Led 7 (Yellow) wired to the I/O 34 (Pin 63)
  If input 2 ON led 7 ON; if input 2 OFF led 7 OFF
  
- Leds yellow LD6 and LD7 are used in several cases. The first one is during the check of validity of the
  Phone number saved into the first index of the PhoneBook. In this case this two leds blink alternatively
  whit a period of 500mSec (250mSec LD6 ON and LD7 OFF; 250mSec LD6 OFF and LD7 ON)
  The next case is when the input 1 (LD6) or input 2(LD7) are active. When the inputs are not active 
  then the leds are off

- Led associated to the outgoing SMS: Led 8 (Green) wired to the I/O 33 (Pin 66)
  If outgoing SMS Led 8 ON otherwise OFF
- Led associated to the outgoing Call: Led 8 (Green) wired to the I/O 33 (Pin 66)
  If outgoing Call Led 8 Blink otherwise OFF

- Led associated to the incoming SMS: Led 9 (Green) wired to the I/O 32 (Pin 65)
  If incoming SMS Led 9 ON otherwise OFF
- Led associated to the incoming Call: Led 9 (Green) wired to the I/O 32 (Pin 65)
  If incoming Call Led 9 Blink otherwise OFF

* Functions supported

- Input/Output report. This function, if enabled, sends the states of  the Inputs and outputs when the 
  corresponding timeout expired
  
- PowerUp SMS. This function, if enabled, sends the Power Up SMS

- StartUp SMS. This function, if enabled, sends the Start Up SMS

- SMS of the Inputs State. This function sends the state of the inputs. The state of the inputs are send only
  of the first eight number of the phonebook if enabled. Also, if enabled, this function perform a voice call
  (Only the first eight number in the phonebook are enabled to receive a voice call)

- Incoming call. This function is used to manage an incoming call. When incoming call occur, and the phone
  number is included into a phonebook, then the system use this to pilot the relay 1
  
- Check first location of the PhoneBook. This function check the first location of the PhoneBook and if no
  validit number is found the system enter in a wait state for five minutes. In this time laps the system
  wait a phonic call to freeze a phone number into the phonebook (Admin User)

- Incoming SMS. This function is used to manage the incoming SMS and, if the message is valid, the 
  command will be execute
  
- Outgoing Echo SMS. This function, if enabled, is used to send at the phone number selected the SMS received and
  not processed because it isn't a valid command

- Outgoing Answer SMS. This function sends at the phone number, used to send a setup command, the answer
  through an SMS where required
